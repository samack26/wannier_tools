WannierTools
============

**WannierTools: an open-source software package for novel topological materials**

Source on Github : https://github.com/quanshengwu/wannier_tools

Aiming to investigate topoligical properties of 

* Electron systems (Tested)

* Phonon systems (Testing)

**Updates**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Develop branch 2018 June 27
We added the test version of phonon system. Welcome to git clone the develop branch and test it.
git clone https://github.com/quanshengwu/wannier_tools.git


WannierTools V2.3.0

1. Fixed a bug.
2. Add Translate_to_WS_calc in the CONTROL namelist. This works for BulkFS_plane_calc.

WannierTools V2.2.9
1. Fixed several bugs.

2. Added two new functionalities:

a. Calculate the energy levels at given k points in the KPOINTS_3D card. This is called the point mode.

b. Calculate anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC).


WannierTools V2.2.6

1. Discard the Miller indicies

2. Discard the third vector in the SURFACE card. The surface plane is specified only by two lattice vectors sitting on it.

**Advertisement**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We already developed a tool to symmetrize Wannier tight binding models. It can symmetrize your wannier90_hr.dat which made of 
s, p, d and f orbitals. However, it is not released and under testing (The new version after May 10 2018 is more powerful and accurate).
If you want to use this part, plase contact one of our 
developers Changming Yue (yuechangming8 at gmail.com).  Before contacting him, please make sure that the Wannier functions you constructed should
are atomic-like orbitals. If you use random projectors in the Wannier90.win, we can't help you to symmetrize the Hamiltonian.
